## Usage

Depcop is supposed to be used with [Depdump](https://github.com/upinetree/depdump/) (or compatible JSON structures).

Quick start:

    $ cd my/cool/ruby/project
    $ depdump | depcop

or

    $ depcop dep.json
    $ depcop `cat dep.json`

You can try examples in this repo.

    $ depdump examples/circular_dependencies | depcop

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
